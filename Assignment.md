# Assessment Instrument 3 - Data Visualisation (Year 11 - Semester 1 - Data science)

> The goal of this task is to demonstrate a simple execution of the data science process. You will need to write a report that details your process through the steps below, as well as develop a codebase that will provide you with the data you need for your analysis.

## Step 1: Choose a data source

We sometimes begin by asking a question, and sometimes we begin by exploring to find a question. In this case, we're going for the latter. Start by choosing a set of data you think will contain interesting information. There are a number of places you could find data, some of which we've looked at in class, such as:

* [ACT | Open Data](https://www.data.act.gov.au/)
* [Citi Bike System Data - NYC](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
* [GitHub - awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets: A topic-centric list of HQ open datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)

## Step 2: Clean the Data

After identifying a data source you think will be interesting. You should inspect it to identify any obvious issues you might have. The most common errors that you can encounter and should look out for are missing values and corrupted or inappropriate values like invalid entries.

## Step 3: Explore the Data & Form your Hypothesis

Now that you have easily explorable data, you need to look through it to identify any patterns or anomalies that could prove interesting. This is also when you'll begin to form your hypothesis. What is an interesting question you could ask that you could use this data to answer?

## Step 4: Analyse the Data

Having formed your hypothesis, you should now with focus and detail analyse the data to try and find an answer to your question.

## Step 5: Communicate the Results

Lastly, create a visualisation of your data to effectively communicate the answer to your hypothesis. This should include a discussion on the social and ethical implications of your findings as well.

## Submission Files

There will be two key submission for this assignment:

* A report that details your process through the steps outlined above, presents your hypothesis and then answers it using your analysis of your data and your visualisations in a meaningful way.
* The codebase that you developed and used to clean your data and produce your visualisations. (<-- this)
